## Skill Development

### Creating a New Skill

1. Create a new directory in `skills/` with your skill name
2. Create a `SKILL.md` file with metadata and documentation:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does
license: MIT
compatibility: Requirements and dependencies
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0.0"
  repository: https://github.com/your-repo
allowed-tools: tool1 tool2 tool3
---

# Your Skill Name

[Documentation content]
```

3. Organize your skill with the following structure:

```
skills/your-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Main documentation and metadata
├── scripts/          # Executable scripts and tools
├── examples/         # Usage examples
├── references/       # Reference documentation
└── tests/           # Test files (if applicable)
```

### Best Practices

- **Self-contained**: Skills should be complete packages that can be used independently
- **Well-documented**: Include clear usage instructions and examples
- **Tool requirements**: Specify exactly which VS Code Copilot tools are needed
- **Error handling**: Implement robust error handling in scripts
- **Compatibility**: Document system requirements and dependencies
